Login: A login component for existing users.
Profile: A component displaying user information with edit functionality.
Reset Password: A component for the password reset process.
Security Considerations
Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
Store passwords securely using hashing and salting.

User Management Overview
User Registration

Form: Create a registration form in your React frontend.
Validation: Implement client-side validation (e.g., email format, password strength).
API: Set up a POST endpoint in NestJS to handle user registration.
Password Hashing: Use libraries like bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in SQLite.
User Authentication

Login Form: Create a login form for users to enter their credentials.
API: Implement a POST endpoint to validate user credentials.
JWT: Use JSON Web Tokens for authentication. Issue a token upon successful login that the frontend can store (e.g., in localStorage).
Middleware: Protect routes in your NestJS app using guards to check for a valid JWT.
User Profile Management

Profile Page: Allow users to view and update their profiles.
API: Create GET and PUT endpoints to fetch and update user data.
Validation: Ensure data is validated both on the client and server sides.
Password Reset

Forgot Password: Implement a feature where users can request a password reset link.
Email Service: Use an email service (like Nodemailer) to send reset links.
Reset Form: Create a form to allow users to set a new password after verifying their identity.
User Roles and Permissions (Optional)

Roles: Define roles (e.g., admin, user) if your application requires different levels of access.
Authorization: Implement guards in NestJS to restrict access based on user roles.
